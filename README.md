# memeMachine

## Project Description

This project is called memeMachine and is a site allowing users to create memes after providing an image URL and text that makes up the top and bottom portions of the meme. The project incorporates the use of HTML, CSS, and JS to build the interactive webpage and includes the following sections:
* A greeting section welcoming the user and explaining how to use the site
* A basic form section made up of a URL field, two text fields, and a submit button
* A footer section that holds the generated memes
This is the first time I have used JS to access and modify the DOM. The JS is made up of two main event listeners:
* An event listener on the submit button of the form to create the user defined meme
* An event listener to allow the user to remove any generated memes

## Known Issues and Room for Improvements
* Background image covers the entire site and has sudden transitions when more memes are added and increases the body element size
* User can add so much text it overcrowds the image and wraps over itself (could add a character limit attribute to the form)
* Need to make the webpage more responsive
* Add more user input
  * Define image and text size and font
  * Add border to the image
  * Allow download of the meme
  * May be a better way to generate the meme so it is one object
